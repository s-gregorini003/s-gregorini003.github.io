With a quick Google search, you would find out that there\u0026rsquo;s already a library with all the functions required to share messages between Azure and Arduino boards. It is called AzureIoTHub and is the IoT Hub\u0026rsquo;s official Arduino library, published by Azure as a port of the Microsoft Azure IoT device SDK for C). The problem is that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually support any Arduino board. Looking at the README.md file, the hardware currently supported is:\n  ESP8266 based boards with esp8266/arduino\n  SparkFun Thing\n  Adafruit Feather Huzzah\n    ESP32 based boards with espressif/arduino-esp32\n Adafruit HUZZAH32    So, until the next compatibility update, the only way to send telemetry from a Nano 33 IoT to Azure IoT Hub is through third-party libraries.\nPrerequisites To code my workaround, I used the following libraries:\n  ArduinoJson - To encapsulate my data in a JSON message, one of the formats accepted by IoT Hub;\n  WiFiNINA - To connect the board to the WiFi;\n  ArduinoMqttClient - Client that allows to send and receive MQTT messages;\n  ArduinoBearSSL - Port of BearSSL to Arduino, to implement the SSL/TLS protocol;\n  ArduinoECCX08 - Library for the Atmel/Microchip ECC508 and ECC608 crypto chips, used for authentication with IoT Hub with a SelfSigned X.509 certificate;\n  All libraries must be installed on your system before compiling the code (instructions on how to install Arduino libraries can be found here).\nImplementation Unfortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s not that easy. Turns out that in the first version of my code, I could successfully send short messages over Serial and MQTT. But, when I tried to send a JSON text bigger than 256 Bytes (i.e. longer than 256 characters), it arrived at the Hub truncated.\n  Screenshot of the Azure Cloud Shell when receiving a truncated message.  A similar issue is documented here, using a different library for the MQTT client. In that case, the advised solution is to change the value ENTER VALUE TO CHANGE from 256 to 2048, but that implies the following things:\n you\u0026rsquo;d have to edit the library source code, so your program is not reproducible on other systems; you still set a fixed value, which, even if bigger, it\u0026rsquo;s not scalable.    Azure Cloud Shell when the hub is receiving the correct message.  Instead, the solution explained here doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any modification of the libraries' source code, since all the changes are made inside the sketch. Concretely, in the publishMessage() function, we declare the char array named payload, which acts as a temporary buffer to store the JSON document. Then, using serializeJson(), the document is serialized to the buffer and the function returns the number of bytes written, which is stored in payloadSize.\nchar payload[1024]; // length of the char buffer that contains the JSON file, concretely the number of characters included in one message\rsize_t payloadSize = serializeJson(doc, payload);\r Now that we have the message and its size, we can send it via MQTT protocol to the IoT Hub. Through the overloaded function beginMessage() we pass the topic and the message size. Then, using the Print class implemented in ArduinoMqttClient, the JSON document is passed directly in the message body. Finally, the endMessage() function publishes the document to the specified topic.\n// send message, the Print interface can be used to set the message contents\rmqttClient.beginMessage(\u0026quot;devices/\u0026quot; + deviceId + \u0026quot;/messages/events/\u0026quot;, static_cast\u0026lt;unsigned long\u0026gt;(payloadSize));\rmqttClient.print(payload);\rmqttClient.endMessage();\r The complete function, as found in the example code, is the following:\nvoid publishMessage() {\rSerial.println(\u0026quot;Publishing message\u0026quot;);\rconst int capacity = JSON_ARRAY_SIZE(10) + 10*JSON_OBJECT_SIZE(2)+ JSON_OBJECT_SIZE(3) + 280; // Calculation of the JSON doc size, as explained in the documentation\r/* Here is where you should write the body of your message.

Here I cover the methodology used to conduct the measurements, which differs a bit from the standards, given the limited equipment available.\nTL;DR To evaluate the structure-borne sound, the only calibrated instrument I could find was an old, single-axis vibration sensor, without the option to collect either octave band or one-third-octave band measurements. After 336 individual measures (144 with the vibration sensor + 144 with a contact microphone + 48 with NTi Audio sound level meters) carried on during a stressful 72 hours period, the results showed that the changes applied to the machine improved its noise emission. However, part of the instrumentation used (the CM-01B contact microphone) proved unsuitable for conducting the measuring process.\n Methodology Test routines - I coded four G-Code procedures for tests reproducibility, numbered to match the name conventions on the collected data. Obviously, routine 1 and 2 do not require any G-Code file, since the 3D printer is not moving.\n Background noise; Source idling; Source with simulated load, under normal working conditions (test-routine-a.gcode); Source at maximum operating speed (test-routine-c-full-speed.gcode); Source working under conditions corresponding to maximum sound generation representative of normal use (specimen-d-infill-only.gcode); Source undergoing a charateristic work cycle (specimen.gcode);  Structure-borne sound - As I said previously, this set of tests couldn\u0026rsquo;t be conducted according to the standard BS ISO 9611:1996, but I tried to follow the procedure as far as possible. I collected 3-axis measurements on each of the 4 predefined supports and for each routine, using both the contact microphone CM-01B and the vibration meter Bruel \u0026amp; Kjaer 2537: the former returned Z-weighted sound pressure level in one-thirdoctave bands (from 20 Hz to 20 kHz), while the latter a single acceleration value. Both were time-averaged over each routine duration.\n  Setup to measure structure-borne sound on the z-axis.  Airborne sound - On the other hand, I could perform this tests according to BS EN ISO 1680:2013 and BS EN ISO 3746:2010. For this test, I conducted 6 measurements at each of the 4 microphone positions outlined by the standards, before and after the changes. The collected data were A-weighted sound pressure levels in one-third-octave-bands (from 20 Hz to 20 kHz), time-averaged over the routine average duration.\nMachine Survey and Improvements After the first analysis and measurement session, the printer showed the following weaknesses in terms of noise emission:\n Fans - Even without a systematic measurement, it is clear that the majority of the noise in a 3D printer comes from its fans. In particular, this machine has 4 fans in total, positioned in the following spots: motherboard, extruder, x-axis motor and power supply. The latter was the most problematic, since that fan was always running at full speed. This was caused by the power supply circuit, which has the space dedicated to a mechanical thermostat, but the component was removed and the poles jumped. So, I installed a normally open KSD9700 thermostat in the location and placed inside the large coil. The switch on the thermostat is designed to close if the temperature exceeds 45 degrees Celsius, which is a default con\u000cguration for this type of power supply.    Position of the switching thermostat installed in the power supply.   Motor dampers - The printer under test uses 5 Nema17 stepper motors, which is one of the most common and cheap solutions in the field. Despite their cost, popularity, and performance, these motors are particularly loud, especially when coupled with low resolution controllers like the DRV8825 IC. To address this potential issue, I decided to install mechanical dampers between the motor and the 3D printer frame.    Installation of the motor dampers.   Bearings - Another potential source of noise and vibration was found in the linear bearings of the y-axis. These three bearings allow the heated bed to move without friction along the cylindrical rails. In the original design of the printer, they were spherical bearings, which require lower tolerances to work, but are prone to lose performance over time. They have been substituted by self-lubricating polymer bearing, which have no moving parts, and therefore are quieter, more precise and durable.  Results All considered, this project is satisfactory: the data show improvements in most of the tested modes. After processing the raw data according to the relative standards, I plotted the before/after comparisons. Moreover, I\u0026rsquo;ve found out that a CM-01B contact microphone can\u0026rsquo;t be used to collect reliable vibration data!\n  Comparison between the data collected with the CM-01B for the y-axis.  Apart from this finding, the other procedures show significant improvements on the noise emitted by the 3D printer. As you can se by the following graph, I was able to isolate and reduce specific frequencies in the machine (in this example, the peak at around 1000 Hz corresponds to cooling fan of the power supply).\n  Airborne sound power level for test routine a.

The project discusses the potentials of achieving high performance in terms of sound absorption through additive manufacturing techniques.\nThe absorbers are designed to exploit the principle of passive destructive interference (PDI) and manufactured using a commercially available fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer. The specimen are cylindrical and produced with cavities of different lengths. The absorption coefficient is evaluated using an impedance tube and following the specifications of the standard BS EN ISO 10534-2:2001.\nThe results show that significant sound absorption can be achieved, although some absorption peaks do not match the expected frequencies. This may be caused by turbulence and resonance phenomena, especially in samples with greater diameter of the cavity. Futher investigation is required, but the potential of these technologies in terms of efficiency over manufacturing cost and absorber size is undoubted.\n Introduction The aim of the project is to design and manufacture Passive Destructive Interference (PDI) absorbers using Additive Manufacturing (AM) techniques and then to evaluate their performance through a low cost, self-built impedance tube. The main outcome of the measurement process is a set of diagrams of the normal absorption factor of the specimens as a function of frequency in a mid-low spectrum range. The sound absorption curves will be then analyzed to determine the effects of the tested geometries and to verify if the experimental results agree with the values expected from the samples in the design phase.\nTheory and Methodology The investigated devices are designed to absorb specific frequencies through passive destructive interference. These frequencies depend mainly on the specimen\u0026rsquo;s geometry, and can be calculated in advance through the following equation\n$$f_n = \\frac{(2n - 1)* c}{2L}$$\nwhere L (m) is the length of the cavity and c (m/s) is the speed of sound in the air.\n  Specification and design of a specimen.  I designed the samples in SolidWorks and manufactured with an AthorBot Brother Desktop 3D Printer. To test different materials, both geometries were printed in ABS and PETG.\n  Two specimen used for measurement.  The measurement of the absorption coefficient was conducted according to the two-micophone technique detailed in BS EN ISO 10534-2:2001. The biggest issue faced in this project was to find an impedance tube to conduct the evaluation. Since my university had part of the equipment (microphones, soundcard, speakers\u0026hellip;), in the end I decided to build a low-cost impedance tube. I built it out of pvc pipes, hydraulic seals, and I added an Arduino Uno with an OLED display and temperature/humidity sensors to keep track of the environmental conditions. To calibrate the tube and conduct the measuring process - which consisted in measuring the cross-transfer function and then calculating the absorption coefficient - I used the software Holmarc Wave Analyzer 4C .\n  Measurement test equipment layout.  Findings For each specimen, measurements are taken in the frequency interval 100-3200 Hz. The normal sound absorption curves are analysed through the evaluation of two values:\n The frequency of peak sound absorption The frequency range between the values on both sides of the peak where half the peak sound absorption occurs.  Using those values, the effects of the tested geometries can be determined and compared to the expected theoretical values. The results show that significant sound absorption has been achieved. The sound absorption coefficient reaches values of 0.87 at peak frequencies in the range considered. However, it must be noted that the absorption bandwidth is relatively narrow and that many relatively lower peaks can be attributed to the unprofessional measuring equipment.\nFor example, the following figure shows that the predicted frequency of the peaks for sample A is respected mainly in the lower range, while they are slightly shifted in the mid-upper range considered, probably due to production defects in the specimen.\n  Measured absorption coefficient for sample A compared to predicted peak frequencies.

In its strictiest meaning, chiptune is used to refer to music created entirely from the original, vintage audio chips (nevertheless, modifications that do not alter the nature of the sound produced are \u0026ldquo;allowed\u0026rdquo;, but we\u0026rsquo;ll come back to this later). On the other hand, the broadest definition is more related to the aesthetics of the sound, rather then to the source generating it. In general, the philosophy behind the chiptune movement is to exploit the limited resources of the hardware to create more and more articulated music.\nDMG-01 With its four audio channels, the Game Boy is supposedly the most popular tool for the production of micromusic. This console has been around for quite some time (Nintendo released it in 1989), and over the course of the years many people created and documented mods to equip it with useful features for the cause, such as better audio, rechargeable battery, backlit screen\u0026hellip;\n   Channel Type Features     1 Pulse Volume envelope, 4-mode pulse width, frequency register from C3 upwards, frequency envelope   2 Pulse Volume envelope, 4-mode pulse width, frequency register from C3 upwards   3 Wave User-definable waveforms, bank of 32 samples (4-bit each), frequency register from C2 upwards   4 Noise White and brown noise    What I want to do with this project is to use some of these mods as a starting point to transform that portable device into a proper music production tool, without over-denaturing its essence.\nFirst Design Initially, I started this project as a university assignment, which is why I was able to document everything in detail (specifically, in this Github repo). Back then, my idea was to tear apart a Game Boy, rewire it from the inside to a different controls and put everything into a new, original case.\n  3D model made with SolidWorks to show the exploded view of the final product.  Unfortunately, towards the end of the semester I realised that creating a custom shell for my product was a task way harder than expected. So, after many stressful weeks, I decided - in accordance with my lecturers - to give up with the enclosure and present only a working prototype. Anyway, the exam went well, but I still want to bring this project to an end.\nReferences Collins, K. and Kapralos, B. and Tessler, H. and Paul, J. L. (2014) The Oxford Handbook of Interactive Audio.

I really hope to go back as soon as possible and continue this journey.\nVolca Boy is a modding project aimed at turning a 1989 Game Boy into a portable synthesizer/sequencer. Although most of the work is original and designed by me, I borrowed some mods and code from other open source projects. In that case, I will give all the necessary credits to the modders from which I borrowed. This project is open source too, so feel free to try it, modify it, add and remove things to it as you like.\nThe links will appear as the project progresses and the steps get documented.\n Intro Mods Overview Software Hardware - Electrical Hardware - Case Demo  ","date":1588518826,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588518826,"objectID":"ec1040604518f09b6ffc2971631c2015","permalink":"/post/volca-boy-0/","publishdate":"2020-05-03T16:13:46+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/volca-boy-0/","section":"post","summary":"IMPORTANT NOTICE Unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this project is currently paused.

I graduated from Leeds Beckett University with an MSc in Audio Engineering and received the \u0026ldquo;Solid State Logic Award for Highest Achieving Postgraduate Student\u0026rdquo;. I passed with Distinction with a thesis titled Small-Footprint Keyword Spotting System for Low Power Applications Using Convolutional Neural Networks.\nFuture Aims I am currently looking for a PhD program starting in 2021 in machine learning for digital musical instruments, augmented/virtual reality, machine audition or 3D printing applications. I am also considering to undertake internships, either before or whilst researching. If you would like to arrange a meeting, please contact me.\n In short, I try to:  Do my part in building the best sci-fi future possible. Have fun in the process. Keep learning new things that push my curiosity forward.   Previous Achievements   I completed the following MOOCs on Coursera:\n TensorFlow in Practice Specialization by Deeplearning.ai Machine Learning by Stanford University.    I designed and developed the Infrastructural Control Electronic System (ICES) for GP2 S.r.l..\n  In 2018, I obtained a BSc degree in Mechanical and Materials Engineering at the University of Brescia (Italy), with a grade of 93/110 (equivalent to a 2:1 Honours) and a thesis titled CoCr Alloys for Biomedical Applications Produced by Additive Manufacturing: Overview on Processes, Properties and Applications.\n  Towards the end of my Bachelors, I worked as an intern at QPRO S.r.l.. My tasks were to perform quality assurance on 3D printed metal components and to help with the maintenance of an EOS M280.\n  Other Interests Alongside the academic work, I have various passions and interests that often intertwine. Some of them are:\n 3D printing - Probably the interest most linked with all the others. With a 3D printer you can basically make everything. Video Games - Both modern and retro gaming. Chiptune - I restore and mod old consoles (mostly Game Boys) to compose and play music. Music - I play drums and produce electronic music. Guitar and bass are still a work in progress.

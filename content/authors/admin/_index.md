I am a R&D engineer at [GP2](https://www.gp2.info) developing a system for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance of buildings and infrastructures.
My primary functions are something in between a data scientist, software developer and embedded engineer. 

In 2019, I decided to move from Brescia (Italy) to Leeds (United Kingdom) to study. I graduated a year later with a MSc in Audio Engineering, with a thesis on 
speech recognition for low power applications.

Now, I am looking for opportunities to develop my professional career. Being passionate about music, video games, research and artificial intelligence, I want to make a real 
impact by collaborating on exciting and fulfilling projects that bring together creativity and advanced technologies.

- The Plan

I've always struggled with generating a consistent and purely creative output. You could say I'm a *natural* when it comes to technical projects, things that have a clear, quantifiable goal: developing a self-hosted cloud solution, building a website, hack the kallax in my living room to add magnetic doors. But when the task has no clear end (e.g. create a music album, write a blog, do a photography project) my brain freezes. No end means no defined path, no fixed list of steps to perform (or tentative solutions to try): the only way to move forward is to explore, experiment in every direction and constantly revise your position to be able to plan your next step.

This is why I decided to start writing this blog. Inspired by Ness Labs&&& and writing to learn&&&, I got to the conclusion that, out of all the creative projects that I'd like to embark on in this lifetime, writing is the most easily approachable. There are multiple reasons for this:

- I'm already used to write all the time. I've been taking notes in my Obsidian&&& vault for years, and since 04-11-2022 I started logging journal entries for both my work and my personal life. This helped me to overcome the fear of the blank page and the infinite revision loop that comes from perfectionism.
- I can write anywhere. I don't need to use dedicated tools, or to be in a specific environment. The bar to start writing is so low that I just need to overcome that initial friction, like when you'd like to go out for a run first thing in the morning, so you prepare your outfit and running shoes on a chair the night before. To write, I don't need any setup. I just have to open my laptop, phone or notebook.
- The outcome is instantly gratifying. I wouldn't say that I like writing quote Zinsser?&&&, but I love having written. And this differs from photography or music production in the sense that, with writing, I'm almost always satisfied with what I produce. Even if it isn't the best piece ever written, seeing my thoughts organised on the page makes the process worth.

So, why do I write? 

- I write to produce a significant output. 
- I write to learn, and to remember.
- I write to explore and improve how I think.

Who am I writing for?

At this time, mainly for myself. I don't exclude that, at some point, I might consider writing to connect with people, or to express concepts and feelings to my close ones. But for now, this remains a *public* introspective project.

Then why making a public blog? 

Good question. I guess to have some sort of accountability. Even if no one reads it, the idea of putting things out there is enough to give me a sense of responsibility that keeps me going. Also, I have a fear of producing and letting out in the world useless noise (AI written books? &&&), which helps to maintain a certain level of quality.

What do I love learning about?

Absolutely everything. And I mean it. Artificial intelligence, personal knowledge management, finance, you name it. 

What's your plan then?

Using Ness Labs&&& PACT, I want to write one post a week.

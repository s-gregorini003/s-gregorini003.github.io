> ## IMPORTANT NOTICE
>
> **Unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this project is currently paused. The reason is that I had to leave my house in Leeds and temporarily return to my hometown in Italy, leaving most of my stuff in the UK. I really hope to go back as soon as possible and continue this journey.**

Volca Boy is a modding project aimed at turning a 1989 Game Boy into a portable synthesizer/sequencer. Although most of the work is original and designed by me, I borrowed some mods and code from other open source projects. In that case, I will give all the necessary credits to the modders from which I borrowed. This project is open source too, so feel free to try it, modify it, add and remove things to it as you like. 
   
The links will appear as the project progresses and the steps get documented.

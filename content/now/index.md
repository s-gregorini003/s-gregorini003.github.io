## Still Exploring the 'Verse

My current role is Audio Programmer II at [Cloud Imperium Games](https://cloudimperiumgames.com), where I've been employed for 2 years, 8 months and 23 days.

In Q4 2023, I became the audio code owner for **Ship Flight and Vehicle Experience**. I've been supporting features like [master modes](https://youtu.be/xGM60FRVolY?si=Fi4M6Mnncjrz4DYo&t=975), [quantum travel rework](https://youtu.be/xGM60FRVolY?si=i43foUdJuNmYcwR4&t=1230), structural salvage, tractor beams, and other exciting projects that aren't ready to be shared yet!

Along with the rest of the audio code team, I am still carrying on the development of our in-house audio engine **[CIGAudio](https://youtu.be/URuzW0a8aY4?si=MsJAXjwFXD4Btz9K)**, and its associated design tool **Claudius**.

Every day, I try to learn as much as possible from this industry and all my amazing colleagues.

## Time to Create

After lots of procrastination, doubts and excuses, I properly started this blog! 

Over the past years, I have been neglecting my creative vein, often falling into the "it's not good enough" mindset. My inner critic kept blocking me from creating and sharing music pieces, photographs or articles. It's time to change that.

## Riding Shai-Hulud and Learning to Write

I'm totally absorbed by the Dune universe. I watched [Dune: Part Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Way9Dexny3w) and it quickly became one of my favourite movies (along with the first part, [Dune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g18jFHCLXk)). At the end of February, I finished reading [Dune Messiah](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dune-Messiah-2-Frank-Herbert/dp/1473655323/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1JGQCV2NICX3S&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.J1uFIAli4AbuGCUJWzq73ftZ8gnqR0CGgQ08BxuS30Ji1DZdAUFbQfcPY8h8bR5KtHlKTc1utIHbF_QXKsJELWYjPYhBSyvtDztrUT3zrGXuye6_kzU3IFY2QNltvD0301eQJ-46XaLN8Fmw8b0heykQ_e3WG2sLixbshkJD0PTSYw8dNmTsbDZd1kvgh8MdsZucxVWhRH8fy_GV4wQTpbiLxuQ0ZXXFnDSCUETPq08.n9E-mWn3Ckk1sZ4kN8s7HgttWTDfnHn_qKLMGdhjLAA&dib_tag=se&keywords=dune+messiah&qid=1709931083&s=books&sprefix=dune+messia%2Cstripbooks%2C94&sr=1-1), and now I'm about to dive into [Children of Dune](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Children-Dune-Third-Novel/dp/147323378X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1ZRM4N7C1850D&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.sZXoO93gRyzuWjntp5USaPgrApHVaGUCQuQJQmd75OyKQTmwt8PP9rNIiFWRm_WaHBqvXgVvem0kZh8h0u1jWjKyR8tTJyWYsHPyyyDkLLf8ML4CHNltdkMLGYYCnDi5IpUrNv3f7bV_sH2_sBmbo3hpdhRm2T5Dlxek_Qethk1T5PDb-x6-8jcpRqMqyxVSZUZU_S0xQK_NpcLGMJ7J-rTsef_7dLzzYi_WI9Q6Z_Y.ZfwbfMIUufDlLzlEj5NOTL6Hy7MIYpO3j4Rdz-jtYKI&dib_tag=se&keywords=children+of+dune&qid=1709931095&s=books&sprefix=children+of+%2Cstripbooks%2C245&sr=1-1). 

Aside from Arrakis, I am exploring the topic of writing through the works of [William Zinsser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Zinsser): I am making my way through [Writing to Learn](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Writing-Learn-William-Zinsser/dp/0062720406) and planning to read [On Writing Well](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/141775057X) and [Writing About Your Life](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Writing-About-Your-Life-Journey/dp/1569243794) next.
